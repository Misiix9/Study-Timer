# 🎉 Firebase Migration Complete!

Your Study Timer application has been successfully migrated from PostgreSQL/NextAuth to Firebase! 

## What Changed

✅ **Authentication**: Now uses Firebase Auth instead of NextAuth.js  
✅ **Database**: Now uses Firestore instead of PostgreSQL  
✅ **Dependencies**: Removed Prisma, NextAuth, and PostgreSQL dependencies  
✅ **User Management**: Simplified user registration and authentication  

## Next Steps

### 1. Set up Firebase (Required)

Your app is now ready to use Firebase, but you need to:

1. **Create a Firebase project** at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. **Enable Authentication** (Email/Password method)
3. **Create a Firestore database**
4. **Configure your environment variables** in `.env`

📖 **Detailed instructions**: See `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for step-by-step guidance.

### 2. Quick Setup Summary

1. Create Firebase project
2. Copy configuration to `.env` file
3. Enable Email/Password authentication
4. Create Firestore database
5. Test registration at `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. What Works Now

- ✅ Landing page loads
- ✅ User registration (once Firebase is configured)
- ✅ User sign-in (once Firebase is configured)
- ✅ Dashboard with user info
- ✅ Sign out functionality

### 4. What You'll Need to Add Later

Once Firebase is configured, you can add:
- Study session tracking
- Subject management
- Analytics and charts
- Goal setting
- Timer functionality

## Environment Variables Template

Copy this to your `.env` file after setting up Firebase:

```bash
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-project.firebaseapp.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-project.appspot.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-sender-id"
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"

# Firebase Admin (for server-side operations)
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="your-private-key"
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL="your-service-account-email"
```
