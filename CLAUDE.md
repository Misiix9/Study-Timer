- Ive left you a .md file in this directory called "study-timer-spec.md". I want you to make this exactly how it is explained in the file. I want you to make a full plan with every steps, and for every step make all of the sub-steps. I want you to always go by the plan, no matter what. Every sub-step has to be made before continuing to the next step. Please use the MCP servers you have for the right things as well troughout the whole project.
